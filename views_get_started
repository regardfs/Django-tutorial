1. what is views？

The views is a list of functions which tight relevantly with config in urls.py，when you visit a website，Django will
firstly analyze your url by patterns which defined in url.py file, then resort to the function name in views.py and
handle request by the function and return httpresponse.

so the whole process is:

web browser => visit request => website => django urls.py => django views.py

2. get views from model(database)

# from django.shortcuts import render_to_response
# from restaurants.models import Restaurant, Food
